<p> When designing and creating our website, we made sure to have universal accessibility in mind. We utilized semantic HTML tags, to make it easier for screen readers and people with poor internet connection to access the site. </p>
<p> After uploading our HTML markup to Achecker, we received feedback on a few aspects of our design. First of all, we had omitted the ‘lang’ attribute from the opening HTML tag. This attribute makes it easier for both computers and people to understand which language the page is written in.  </p>
<p> Second, we were notified of a potential issue regarding our lack of the thead tag in our table element. This tag makes it clear for users what the table is presenting. Without the thead tag, users may have a difficult time comprehending what the table tries to describe. We decided to implement a thead tag for our menu, which in our opinion makes the website more legible and easier to navigate.</p>
<p>Furthermore we had forgot to give a proper title text within the title tag. Our first version simply had “Restaurant Navn” as the title, which clearly does not describe the content fully. We decided to write a new title. The new title we ended up with is as follows: “Pilestredet Restaurant | Menu | Opening hours | Contact information”. We believe this gives the users a better picture of what the website presents. </p>
<p> Additionally, we initially had chosen a semi-dark grey color as our main color for all of the text on the website. After reviewing the site for accessibility, we decided to change to a font color that had a greater contrast to our chosen background. Since our background is dark, we decided that it would be beneficial to use white as our main font color. This makes it easier for people with poor vision to read our sites content. </p>
<p> At last, we decided to change how the navigation links responded to user interaction. To begin with, the navigation links did not respond until the user click on them. At which point, they simply forwarded the user to the correct section of the page. After our revision, the navigation links now have a hover effect, which makes it clearer for the user that they are clickable. </p>
<p>To conclude, we believe that all of our changes have made the website easier to use and more accessible for users – no matter what kind of device they are using.</p>
